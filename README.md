This project presents a complete Sales Performance Analysis using SQL, Python (Pandas), and Power BI on the Superstore retail dataset. The workflow includes importing and cleaning raw sales data, transforming inconsistent date and text formats, and performing analytical SQL queries to calculate regional sales, top-selling products, monthly revenue trends, repeat customers, and product rankings. Python was used for deeper data exploration, handling missing values, customer segmentation, moving averages, and identifying high-value customers. Finally, the cleaned data was visualized in Power BI through interactive dashboards featuring revenue trends, product performance charts, customer segmentation visuals, heatmaps, category-wise contributions, and KPI cards. This end-to-end project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, analysis, and business intelligence reporting.
